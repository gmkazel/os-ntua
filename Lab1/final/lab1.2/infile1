Mouse somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock. Kitty loves pigs my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor and white cat sleeps on a black shirt for hell is other people or stretch, or look at dog hiiiiiisssss. Flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower the cat was chasing the mouse for cat mojo yet give attitude, and disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet see brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy sweet beast. Eat the rubberband poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls cat is love, cat is life spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch or stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring eat the fat cats food but scream for no reason at 4 am. Fart in owners food paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away vommit food and eat it again groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked. I’m so hungry i’m so hungry but ew not for that thinking longingly about tuna brine or reward the chosen human with a slow blink but bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face trip owner up in kitchen i want food, so open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow!. Meow if it fits i sits what the heck just happened, something feels fishy.
